UNLOCK
Shekhar is a bomb defusal specialist. 
He once encountered a bomb that can be defused only by a secret code.
He is given a number N and a number K. And he is also given permutation of first N natural numbers.
The defusal code is the largest permutation possible by doing exactly K swaps among a pair of the given permutation. 
Help him to find the final permutation.

Input Format:
First line contains â€‹an integer N and an integer k. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the given permutation.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5 1<= K <= 10^9

Output Format
The final permutation of the numbers with every number separated by a space with other number.
